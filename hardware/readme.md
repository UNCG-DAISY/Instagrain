# This is the hardware folder

There are multiple versions of both the camera case and the electronics/hardware.

V1: is fully 3d printed. We strongly recommend using an SLA printer. We have verified this model works with a FormLab 3+ using grey pro resin. 

V2: relies on a custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure and a few 3D printed parts. Again we recommend an SLA printer (we used a Formlab 3/3+ and Grey pro resin), but have heard of success using an FDM printer. 

V3: A smaller custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure, with fewer mounting points, and iterating on some design choices. Again there are a few 3D printed parts, and we recommend an SLA printer (we used a Formlab 3/3+ and Grey pro resin), but have heard of success using an FDM printer. 

In the future, we hope to provide an even smaller form factor, but the full size RPi-branded 7 inch touchscreen is extremely nice to work with in the field (and in the lab).
