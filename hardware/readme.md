# Camera hardware

This directory addresses two aspects of the camera: 

- the 3D printed case of tha camera
- the electronic assembly of the camera. 

-----

## 3D Printed case

There are 5 `.stl` files 

1. [Camera body](./body*)
2. [Light mount](./light*)
3. [Battery case](./battery*)
4. [Screen Mount](./screen*)
5. [USB Door](./usbdoor*)

We recommend printing all of them with a SLA printer with a build volumne of XXX and using rigid resin.

Printing takes roughly XXX with a XXX printer

Instructions for assembly are forthcoming.
