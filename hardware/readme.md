# Camera hardware

This directory addresses two aspects of the camera: 

- the 3D printed case of tha camera
- the electronic assembly of the camera.

## 3D Printed case

There are 5 `.stl` files 

1. [Camera body](./body_sedicamsmallerv2.stl)
2. [Light mount](./lightmount.stl)
3. [Battery case](./battery_case.stl)
4. [Screen Mount](./screen_mount.stl)
5. [USB Door](./usbdoor_sedicam.stl)

We recommend printing all of them with a SLA printer with a build volumne of XXX and using rigid resin.

Printing takes roughly XXX with a XXX printer

Instructions for assembly are forthcoming.
