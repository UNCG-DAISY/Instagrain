** please refer to the Wiki for instructions on how to build the device **

There are multiple versions of both the camera case and the electronics/hardware.

V1: The Case is fully 3d printed. We strongly recommend using an SLA printer. We have verified this model works with a FormLab 3+ using grey pro resin.

V2: This new case is a custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure and a few 3D printed parts. Again we recommend an SLA printer (we used a Formlab 3/3+ and Grey pro resin), but have heard of success using an FDM printer. There are mounting holes for an (optional) Google Coral edgeTPU, the GPS is provided by an Adafruit GPS hat connected to an external antenna (via an adaptor). 

V3: A smaller custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure, with fewer mounting points, and iterating on some design choices. Again there are a few 3D printed parts, and we recommend an SLA printer (we used a Formlab 3/3+ and Grey pro resin), but have heard of success using an FDM printer. The mounting holes for the Google Coral edgeTPU are eliminated, we switched to a USB GPS to simplify the BOM/parts list.

Notes:
- All `.stp` files can be viewed using [Autodesk Viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com)
- The camera tent is interchangeable between V2 and V3, as is the ring light holder. (but the screen brackets are different between V2 and V3)
