There are currently 2 versions of the camera, and a third is on the way.

The first version is fully 3d printed.
The second version relies on a custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure. 
The third version, currently a work in progress, is also a custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure, but slightly smaller, with fewer mounting points, and iterating on some of the design choices we are making. 

In the future, we hope to provide a smaller form factor, but the full size RPi-branded 7 inch touchscreen is extremely nice to work with in the field (and in the lab).
