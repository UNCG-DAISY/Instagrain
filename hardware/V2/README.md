### Major Components

- Most of the major Components can be ordered from our Adafruit wishlist http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/543790
  - The Google Coral can be found at https://coral.ai/products/accelerator  
  - The recommended microSD card can be bought on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDHC-UHS-3-SDSQXAF-032G-GN6MA/dp/B06XWMQ81P/
  - Due to chip shortages in 2021 and 2022, the Raspberry Pi 4 may not be available on Adafruit
- There are two STEP files that can be sent to Polycase* to order the custom-designed, CNC-machined camera housing (expect 1 to 3 week lead time). Polycase should alread have the "setup" complete, which reduces the overall unit cost. 
  - WQ-57C_LID.stp
  - WQ-57_Body.stp

*Instructions for sending requests for custom CNC-machined parts are available at https://www.polycase.com/customized-enclosures

### 3D Parts

There are 4 `.stl` files
- [`Camcover.stl`](./Camcover.stl)
- [`screenbracket.stl`](./screenbracket.stl)
- [`ledmountv2.stl`](./ledmountv2.stl)
- Mountingplate.stl (coming soon)

We recommend printing all of them with a SLA printer with a build volumne of 14.5 × 14.5 × 18.5 cm and using rigid resin.

Printing takes roughly 44.45hrs with a Form3/3+ printer (Look at [`BOMv2.csv`](./BOMv2.csv) for full part breakdown)
