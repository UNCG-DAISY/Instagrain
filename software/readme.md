# This is the software folder

** please refer to the Wiki for instructions on how to set up the software on the device **

There are multiple versions of the case and hardware for hte camera, and we provide here matching versions of the software for each hardware configuration.

The software for the v1 and v2 camera are in the the `v2_and_v1` folder. This is software for the fully 3D printed camera and the larger (v2) custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure. This runs on Raspbian 'Buster', and uses Picamera 

The software for the v3 camera (smaller polycase enclosure) is provided in the `v3_HQ` folder. This runs on Raspbian 'Buster', and uses the Picamera library. 

We are actively developing a version of the v3 camera that relies on the new Raspberry pi autofocus camera module. This si experimental, and provided in the `v3_auto` folder. This runs on Raspbian 'Bullseye', and uses the new Picamera2 library.
