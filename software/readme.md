There are multiple versions of the case and hardware for hte camera, and we provide here matching versions of the software for each hardware configuration.

The software for the v1 and v2 camera are in the the `v2_and_v1` folder. This is software for the fully 3D printed camera and the larger (v2) custom CNC'ed polycase enclosure. This runs on Raspbian 'Buster', and uses Picamera 

The software for the v3 camera (smaller polycase enclosure) is provided in the `v3` folder. This runs on Raspbian 'Buster', and uses the Picamera library.
